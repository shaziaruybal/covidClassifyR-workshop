# Welcome
This is the website for all the materials needed for the four-session workshop to train scientific research officers on how to use the [`covidClassifyR`](https://shaziaruybal.shinyapps.io/covidclassifyr) Shiny web application created by Dr. Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez, Dr. Maria Ome-Kaius and Dr. Fiona Angrisano for the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research. Funding for the development of [`covidClassifyR`](https://shaziaruybal.shinyapps.io/covidclassifyr) and the related training workshops for PNGIMR researchers was generously provided by a [Regional Collaborations Programme COVID-19 Digital Grant](https://www.science.org.au/news-and-events/news-and-media-releases/regional-research-set-get-digital-boost) from the Australian Academy of Science and Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources.

# Overview
This workshop has four sessions where you will learn about the data generated using the COVID-19 serology laboratory assay (also described in [Mazhari et al 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/mps4040072)), the COVID-19 serological surveys that have been carried out by PNGIMR, and an overview of how to use the [`covidClassifyR`](https://shaziaruybal.shinyapps.io/covidclassifyr) Shiny application to process and analyse data to support COVID-19 research efforts. This workshop will be held via Zoom and in-person at PNGIMR Port Moresby and Goroka offices. Data packages for connectivity during the workshops and for use when using the Shiny application will be provided to all participants.

- **Session 1:** 

  - Topic 1: Introduction to the SARS-CoV-2 Luminex multi-antigen serology assay
  - Topic 2: Introduction to the COVID-19 serological surveys that have been conducted in PNG
  - Topic 3: Data preparation and how to go from Luminex machine to Shiny app
