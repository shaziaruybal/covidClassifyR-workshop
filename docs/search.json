Funding for the development of covidClassifyR and the related training workshops for PNGIMR researchers was generously provided by a Regional Collaborations Programme COVID-19 Digital Grant from the Australian Academy of Science and Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nThis workshop has four sessions where you will learn about the data generated using the COVID-19 serology laboratory assay (also described in Mazhari et al 2021), the COVID-19 serological surveys that have been carried out by PNGIMR, and an overview of how to use the covidClassifyR Shiny application to process and analyse data to support COVID-19 research efforts. This workshop will be held via Zoom and in-person at PNGIMR Port Moresby and Goroka offices. Data packages for connectivity during the workshops and for use when using the Shiny application will be provided to all participants.\nSession 1:\nTopic 1: Introduction to the SARS-CoV-2 Luminex multi-antigen serology assay\nTopic 2: Introduction to the COVID-19 serological surveys that have been conducted in PNG\nTopic 3: Data preparation and how to go from Luminex machine to Shiny app\n\nSession 1 leaders:  Dr Angrisano, Dr Ome-Kaius, Dr Ruybal-Pesántez Date:  Thursday, 10th March 2022  8:30-11:30am GMT+10\nSession 2:\nTopic 1: Importing your data to the covidClassifyR app\nTopic 2: How to perform quality control of your data\nTopic 3: Generate your quality control report and look at your processed data\n\nSession 2 leaders:  Dr Ruybal-Pesántez Date:  Friday, 11th March 2022  8:30-11:30am GMT+10\nSession 3:\nTopic 1: Recap of how to perform quality control of your data\nTopic 2: Introduction to the COVID-19 classification algorithm\nTopic 3: How to apply the classification algorithm to your data\n\nSession 3 leaders:  Dr Ruybal-Pesántez Date:  Thursday, 17th March 2022  8:30-11:30am GMT+10\nSession 4:\nTopic 1: Recap of data QC and classification\nTopic 2: How to visualize your data in the covidClassifyR app\nTopic 3: Bring your own data to work on\n\nSession 4 leaders:  Dr Ruybal-Pesántez Date:  Thursday, 24th March 2022  8:30-11:30am GMT+10\nBefore you start\nREQUIREMENTS? Laptop, data package (to be provided)\nAbout the covidClassifyR app\nThis fit-for-purpose analytical tool was developed to streamline the processing of serological data generated using a validated high-throughput multiplex serological assay for measuring antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (Mazhari et al 2021). This tool also aims to make the downstream processing, quality control and interpretation of the raw data generated from this serological assay accessible to all researchers without the need for a specialist background in statistical methods and advanced programming.\nYou can access the covidClassifyR Shiny web application here.\nA tutorial for how to use the application can be accessed here via the “Tutorial” tab.\na fit-for-purpose tool to support COVID-19 sero-surveillance via serological data processing and statistical analysis\nWorkshop materials\nAll of the slides and session materials can be found in the “Materials” tab.\nAcknowledgments\nThis workshop was designed for Papua New Guinea Institute for Medical Research researchers and led by Dr. Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez, Dr. Maria Ome-Kaius and Dr. Fiona Angrisano.\nFunding for this workshop was provided by a Regional Collaborations Programme COVID-19 Digital Grant from the Australian Academy of Science and Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources.\nThis website was made with the distill package by Dr Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez.\n\n\n\n",
